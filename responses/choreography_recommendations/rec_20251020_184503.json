  "notes": "Choreography emphasizes the audio's relaxed (1.0), sad (1.0), and highly danceable (0.93) qualities. Low energy (0.00) demands gentle, flowing movements rather than sharp, aggressive motions. Sequence uses extended idle moments as artistic pauses that complement the melancholic mood while maintaining engagement through smooth, hypnotic sway patterns and gentle emotional expressions. The choreography prioritizes continuous, flowing motion typical of relaxed yet engaging dance styles.",

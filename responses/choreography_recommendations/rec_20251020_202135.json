Balanced with 5 manual position moves for dramatic body turns (spins ranging -100\u00b0 to 110\u00b0). Intro uses gentle gestures; main section launches into sustained high-energy dance combinations. Sad mood (0.63) acknowledged through mood transitions but overridden by perfect danceability requirement. All moves precisely timed to fill exactly 30.0 seconds."

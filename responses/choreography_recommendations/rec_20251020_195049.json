  "choreography_notes": "This choreography emphasizes the sad (1.0) and relaxed (1.0) mood with minimal energy (0.0). The sequence prioritizes gentle swaying, contemplative poses, and calm emotional expressions. Manual body rotations (body_yaw \u00b145\u00b0) are subtle and thoughtful rather than energetic, creating a melancholic exploration of space. Idle pauses are used strategically for dramatic effect and emotional resonance. The danceability (1.10) is satisfied through smooth, flowing movements rather than sharp, rhythmic bursts.",

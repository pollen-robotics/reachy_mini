  - Range sliders for quick adjustment (0.2 step increments)
  - Number inputs for precise values (0.01 precision)
- Two-way synchronization between sliders and number inputs
- Visual safety zones using color gradients
  - Blue zones indicate safe operating range
  - Pink zones warn of extreme positions
- Configurable movement duration (0.1-5.0 seconds)

### üîó Binding Mechanisms

**Added:**

## Design Decisions

### Why Single-File Architecture?

**Rationale:**
- Zero dependencies (beyond CDN Chart.js)
- No build step or tooling required
- Easy to share with beta testers
- Simple version control (one file)
- Works offline (except Chart.js CDN)
- Accessible to beginners

**Tradeoffs:**
- Larger file size (~1700 lines)
- No code splitting
- Global namespace pollution (mitigated with const/let)

**Verdict:** Benefits outweigh costs for this use case.

### Why Vanilla JavaScript Over Framework?

**Rationale:**
- Small codebase (~800 lines JS)
- No complex state management needed
- Excellent performance without framework overhead
- Lower barrier to entry for contributors
- No build tooling complexity

**Tradeoffs:**
- Manual DOM manipulation
- More verbose than React/Vue
- No virtual DOM optimizations

**Verdict:** Vanilla JS is optimal for this tool.

### Why CSS Custom Properties?

**Rationale:**
- Centralized color management
- Easy theme customization
- No CSS preprocessor needed
- Excellent browser support
- Runtime color changes possible

**Benefits:**
- Change entire theme by editing 6 variables
- Consistent color usage throughout
- Maintainable and readable

### Why scaleX(-1) for Antenna Reversal?

**Rationale:**
- Pure CSS solution (no JavaScript complexity)
- Automatically flips gradients correctly
- Visual-only transformation (values unchanged)
- Eliminates need for value negation logic

**Initial Mistake:**
- Attempted to negate values in JavaScript
- Created confusion between visual and actual values
- Led to complex binding logic

**Solution:**
- Use scaleX(-1) for visual flip only
- Both sliders have same min/max/value ranges
- Gradients are identical (flip happens automatically)
- JavaScript logic simplified significantly

**Lesson:** Use CSS transforms for visual changes, not JavaScript.

### Why Chart.js Over Custom Canvas?

**Rationale:**
- Proven, well-tested library
- Beautiful default styling
- Easy bar chart configuration
- Built-in responsive behavior
- Active maintenance and community

**Tradeoffs:**
- External dependency (CDN)
- Slight overhead (~50kb)
- Less customization than raw canvas

**Verdict:** Chart.js is the right choice for maintainability.

### Why Blob API for Export?

**Rationale:**
- No server-side processing needed
- Works entirely in browser
- Standard download UX
- Small, clean implementation

**Alternative Considered:**
- Data URI approach (works but less clean)
- Server endpoint (unnecessary complexity)

**Verdict:** Blob API is modern, clean solution.

### Why Mutual Exclusion for Antenna Bindings?

**Rationale:**
- Normal and inverse binding are contradictory
- Both enabled simultaneously would conflict
- Creates clear user expectations

**Implementation:**
- Event listeners on both checkboxes
- Checking one unchecks the other
- Both can be unchecked (independent control)

**UX Benefit:** Prevents confusion and undefined behavior.

### Why 67% Gradient Blend for Antennas?

**Rationale:**
- Antenna range: -3 to 3 (6 unit span)
- Safe zone: -3 to 1 (4 units)
- Danger zone: 1 to 3 (2 units)
- Math: 4 / 6 = 0.6667 = 67%

**Result:**
- Blend point visually centered over value 1
- Clear indication of danger zone
- Sharper transition than 50% blend

### Why 500px Video Height?

**Rationale:**
- Previous 330px was too small
- Wasted vertical space in left column
- 500px provides better view of simulator
- Still fits on standard laptop screens

**Tradeoff:**
- Less vertical space for chart below
- Acceptable given side-by-side layout change

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Antenna Slider Visual Reversal

**Problem:**
- Right antenna needed to move opposite direction visually
- Initial attempt negated values in JavaScript
- Created confusion between visual position and actual value
- Gradient colors were backwards

**Solution:**
- Use CSS `scaleX(-1)` for visual flip only
- No JavaScript value negation
- Both sliders use identical gradient
- Transform automatically flips gradient correctly

**Code:**
```css
.reversed-slider {
    transform: scaleX(-1);
}
```

**Result:** Clean, simple, correct behavior.

### Challenge 2: Dynamic Move Loading

**Problem:**
- 101 moves in HTML was unmaintainable
- Adding/removing moves required HTML editing
- No version control for move list

**Solution:**
- Externalize moves to `moves.json`
- Fetch JSON on page load
- Dynamically generate radio buttons with JavaScript
- Automatic alphabetical sorting

**Benefits:**
- Add moves by editing one JSON file
- No HTML changes needed
- Easy to version control
- Alphabetical sorting automatic

### Challenge 3: Color Palette Distribution

**Problem:**
- Initial design used too much of one color
- Not utilizing full Pollen Robotics palette
- Lack of visual variety

**Solution:**
- Create individual button color classes
- Distribute colors evenly across interface
- Use semantic color coding (green=success, pink=error)
- Chart bars each get unique color

**Result:** Vibrant, balanced, branded interface.

### Challenge 4: Binding Logic Complexity

**Problem:**
- Yaw binding, antenna normal binding, antenna inverse binding
- All interact with same input handlers
- Risk of infinite loops (A changes B, B changes A)

**Solution:**
- Single event handler per input
- Check all binding states sequentially
- Update paired inputs directly (no events fired)
- Mutual exclusion prevents conflicting bindings

**Lesson:** Centralized binding logic in input handlers prevents issues.

### Challenge 5: WebSocket Reconnection

**Current State:**
- No automatic reconnection implemented
- User must refresh page

**Reason:**
- Keeps code simple for v1.0
- Daemon restarts are rare in practice
- Manual refresh is acceptable workaround

**Future Enhancement:**
```javascript
function connectWebSocket() {
    ws = new WebSocket(url);
    ws.onclose = () => {
        setTimeout(connectWebSocket, 3000);
    };
}
```

### Challenge 6: Chart Performance

**Problem:**
- WebSocket sends ~10 messages/second
- Chart.js animation could cause lag
- Need smooth real-time updates

**Solution:**
- Set animation duration to 100ms (minimal)
- Use `chart.update('none')` for instant updates
- Browser throttles at 60 FPS naturally

**Result:** Smooth, responsive chart updates.

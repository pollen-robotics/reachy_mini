Place the motion reference .npz files generated by `python tests/tools/generate_motion_references.py` in this directory.
Each mode (hardware vs simulation) should live in its own subfolder, e.g.:

- tests/data/dance_references/hardware/simple_nod.npz
- tests/data/dance_references/simulation/simple_nod.npz

The test suite will skip gracefully if the requested files are missing.

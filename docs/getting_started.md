## Getting Started

Reachy Mini robots are sold as kits and need to be assembled. Assembly typically takes around 2 to 3 hours for someone discovering the robot for the first time.

Each kit includes a detailed, step by step assembly guide that walks you through the entire process. No additional tools or prior robotics experience are required, just take your time and follow the instructions.

Once assembled, getting started depends on which version of Reachy Mini you are using.

### Reachy Mini

#### Assembly
You can follow the online assembly guide for Reachy Mini here:

👉 [Reachy Mini (Wireless) assembly guide](LINK_TO_ASSEMBLY_GUIDE)

The guide is accompanied by a full assembly video, which we highly recommend watching alongside the written instructions. It provides helpful visual context and makes the assembly process much smoother.

#### Connect to a Wi-Fi network
Reachy Mini runs its software directly onboard. To get started, you first need to set up the robot’s WiFi connection. Once connected to the network, you can access the robot directly from your browser to configure it and launch applications.

1. Power on your Reachy Mini.
2. Reachy Mini will create its own access point: "reachy-mini-ap". It should appear in the list of available Wi-Fi networks on your computer or smartphone after a few moments.
3. Connect your computer to the `reachy-mini-ap` Wi-Fi network (password: `reachy-mini`). Or you can directly scan the QR-code below to join the network:

4. Open a web browser and go to [http://reachy-mini.local:8000/settings](http://reachy-mini.local:8000/settings) to access the configuration page.
5. Enter your Wi-Fi network credentials (SSID and password) and click "Connect".
6. Wait a few moments for Reachy Mini to connect to your Wi-Fi network. The access point will disappear once connected. If the connection fails, Reachy Mini will restart the access point, and you can try again.

#### Update and access the control Dashboard
1. Update your robot to the latest version by going the [settings page](http://reachy-mini.local:8000/settings)
2. Now you can go to [http://reachy-mini.local:8000/](http://reachy-mini.local:8000/) to access the robot dashboard.

### Reachy Mini Lite

#### Assembly
You can follow the online assembly guide for Reachy Mini Lite here:
👉 [Reachy Mini Lite assembly guide](LINK_TO_ASSEMBLY_GUIDE)

As with Reachy Mini, the guide includes a complementary assembly video that we strongly recommend watching before or during the build.

#### Software setup
Reachy Mini Lite requires a separate computer to run applications. To get started, plug the robot into a power outlet, then connect it to your computer via USB.

You will need to download and install the **Reachy Mini Control** desktop application, which allows you to easily connect to the robot and launch applications.

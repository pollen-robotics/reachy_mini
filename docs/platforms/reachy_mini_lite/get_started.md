# Reachy Mini Lite - Setup Guide

The **Reachy Mini Lite** is the tethered version designed for education and development. It requires a computer to run its intelligence.

## 1. 🔧 Assembly

Reachy Mini comes as a kit. Building it is the first step of your journey!

* **Time required:** 2 to 3 hours.
* **Tools:** Everything is included in the box.
* **Instructions:** We strongly recommend following the video guide alongside the manual.

> **💡 Pro Tip:** We strongly recommend having the **Online Guide** or the **assembly video** open alongside the paper booklet (see below). The online version includes short video extracts for every step, which makes the assembly much easier to understand.

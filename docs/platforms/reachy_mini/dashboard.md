# Reachy Mini Dashboard (Wireless)

The Dashboard is the control center of your Reachy Mini. Since the robot runs autonomously, this web interface allows you to manage it from any computer or smartphone on the same network.

## Accessing the Dashboard

Open your web browser and navigate to:
👉 **[http://reachy-mini.local:8000/](http://reachy-mini.local:8000/)**

*(Note: If `reachy-mini.local` doesn't work, check your router to find the robot's IP address)*

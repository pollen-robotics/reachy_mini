> ⚠️ Reachy Mini is still in beta. Expect bugs, some of them we won't fix right away if they are not a priority.

[Reachy Mini](https://www.pollen-robotics.com/reachy-mini/) is an expressive, open-source robot designed for human-robot interaction, creative coding, and AI experimentation. We made it to be affordable, easy to use, hackable and cute, so that you can focus on building cool AI applications!

### Versions Lite & Wireless

Reachy Mini's hardware comes in two flavors:
- **Reachy Mini lite**: where the robot is directly connected to your computer via USB. And the code that controls the robot (the daemon) runs on your computer.
- **Reachy Mini wireless**: where an Raspberry Pi is embedded in the robot, and the code that controls the robot (the daemon) runs on the Raspberry Pi. You can connect to it via Wi-Fi from your computer (see [Wireless Setup](./docs/wireless-version.md)).

There is also a simulated version of Reachy Mini in [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org) that you can use to prototype your applications before deploying them on the real robot. It behaves like the lite version where the daemon runs on your computer.

# Contributing

This project is actively developed and maintained by the [Pollen Robotics team](https://www.pollen-robotics.com) and the [Hugging Face team](https://huggingface.co/). 

We welcome contributions from the community! If you want to report a bug or request a feature, please open an issue on GitHub. If you want to contribute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.

Development tools are available in the optional dependencies.

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

Your files will be checked before any commit. Checks may also be manually run with

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Checks are performed by Ruff. You may want to [configure your IDE to support it](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/editors/setup/).

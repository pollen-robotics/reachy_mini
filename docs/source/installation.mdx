# Installation of the daemon and Python SDK

As mentioned above, before being able to use the robot, you need to run the daemon that will handle the communication with the motors.

We support and test on Linux and macOS. It's also working on Windows, but it is less tested at the moment. Do not hesitate to open an issue if you encounter any problem. 

The daemon is built in Python, so you need to have Python installed on your computer (versions from 3.10 to 3.13 are supported). We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts with your other Python projects.

You can install Reachy Mini from the source code or from PyPI.

### git-lfs
First, make sure `git-lfs` is installed on your system:

<hfoptions id="Installation">
<hfoption id="Linux">

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```python
# On Linux
sudo apt install git-lfs
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

</hfoption>
<hfoption id="macOS">

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```python
# On macOS
brew install git-lfs
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

</hfoption>

<hfoption id="Windows">

On Windows, [follow the instructions here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage?platform=windows)

</hfoption>
</hfoptions>

### Package installation
From PyPI, you can install the package with:

```bash
pip install reachy-mini
```

From the source code, you can install the package with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini
pip install -e ./reachy_mini
```

> [!TIP]
> *Note that uv users can directly run the daemon with:*
> ```bash
> uv run reachy-mini-daemon
> ```

The same package provides both the daemon and the Python SDK.

### Linux - udev rules setup (Linux only)

On Linux systems, you need to set up udev rules to allow non-root access to the Reachy Mini hardware. Create the udev rules file with:

```bash
echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTRS{idProduct}=="55d3", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout" #Reachy Mini
SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{idVendor}=="38fb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1001", MODE="0666", GROUP="dialout" #Reachy Mini soundcard' \
| sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-reachy-mini.rules
```

After saving the file, refresh the udev rules:

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

Finally, add your current user to the `dialout` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

You may need to log out and log back in for the group changes to take effect.

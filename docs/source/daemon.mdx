# Run the reachy mini daemon

Before being able to use the robot, you need to run the daemon that will handle the communication with the motors. This daemon can run either in simulation (MuJoCo) or on the real robot.

### For real robot

```bash
reachy-mini-daemon
```

or run it via the Python module:

```bash
python -m reachy_mini.daemon.app.main
```

Additional argument for both simulation and real robot:

```bash
--localhost-only: (default behavior). The server will only accept connections from localhost.
```

or

```bash
--no-localhost-only: If set, the server will accept connections from any connection on the local network.
```

> [!TIP]
> **For the lite version (connected via USB)**
> 
> It should automatically detect the serial port of the robot. If it does not, you can specify it manually with the `-p` option:
> 
> ```bash
> reachy-mini-daemon -p <serial_port>
> ```

### In simulation ([MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org))

You first have to install the optional dependency `mujoco`.

```bash
pip install reachy-mini[mujoco]
```

Then run the daemon with the `--sim` argument.

```bash
reachy-mini-daemon --sim
```

Additional arguments:

```bash
--scene <empty|minimal> : (Default empty). Choose between a basic empty scene, or a scene with a table and some objects.
```

*Note: On OSX in order to run mujoco, you need to use mjpython (see [here](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/python.html#passive-viewer)). So, you should run the daemon with:*

```bash
 mjpython -m reachy_mini.daemon.app.main --sim
 ```

### Usage

For more information about the daemon and its options, you can run:

```bash
reachy-mini-daemon --help
```

### Dashboard

You can access a simple dashboard to monitor the robot's status at [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) when the daemon is running. This lets you turn your robot on and off, run some basic movements, and browse spaces for Reachy Mini!

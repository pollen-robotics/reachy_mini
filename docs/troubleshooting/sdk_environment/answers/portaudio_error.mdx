Some users may have an error when launching the daemon for the first time : `OSError: PortAudio library not found`. 

To resolve that, you can install manually this library by executing in the terminal : 

```bash
sudo apt-get install libportaudio2
```

Then you can launch the daemon again : `reachy-mini-daemon`

    "- Multiple clients can connect simultaneously (web app, scripts, notebooks)\n",
    "- The daemon handles low-level hardware safely\n",

    "If anything goes wrong:\n",
    "* **In Jupyter**: Click the \"Stop\" button (■) in the toolbar, or press `Ctrl+C` in terminal\n",
    "* **In Python script**: Press `Ctrl+C`\n",
    "* The `with` statement ensures the robot stops safely when the context exits\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Always use the `with` statement**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   with ReachyMini() as mini:\n",
    "       # Your code here\n",
    "   # Connection automatically closed heresimulation section](https://huggingface.co/docs/reachy_mini/troubleshooting#-simulation\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start with longer durations** (1-2 seconds) when experimenting\n",
    "   - Slower movements are safer\n",
    "   - You can speed up once you're comfortable\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Test small movements first**\n",
    "   - Start with small angles (5-10 degrees)\n",
    "   - Gradually increase range as you learn the limits\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Keep an eye on the robot**\n",
    "   - Watch for unexpected behavior\n",
    "   - Make sure the workspace is clear\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use `media_backend=\"no_media\"` when you don't need camera/audio**\n",
    "   - Saves resources\n",
    "   - Faster connection\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Start in simulation**\n",
    "   - You can also play with Reachy Mini in simulation!\n",
    "   - Just instanciate the daemon with the sim argument. This will open a Mujoco simulation window where you can see and control Reachy Mini without the physical hardware. This is a great way to experiment safely and test your code before running it on the real robot. More information about simulation can be found in the simulation section [TODO: INSERT LINK] of the documentation."

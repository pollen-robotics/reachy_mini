# 📚 Reachy Mini Didactic Notebooks! 

The notebooks are designed for **progressive learning**, from first connection to creative behaviors. You will learn how to use Reachy's SDK and understand its capabilities through practical examples.

Each notebook is:

* Executable in **simulation or on real hardware**
* Focused on **hands-on experimentation**
* Self-contained, with reminders and safety notes

### 🟢 Level 1 — Discovery

**Notebook 0 — Getting Started with Reachy Mini**
👉 Installation checks, daemon, first connection, first motion

**Notebook 1 — Moving Reachy Mini**
👉 `goto_target` vs `set_target`, head pose, antennas, interpolation

---

### 🟡 Level 2 — Understanding

**Notebook 2 — Compliant Mode & Physical Interaction**
👉 Gravity compensation, safety, human–robot interaction

**Notebook 3 — Seeing with Reachy Mini (Camera & Gaze)**
👉 Camera access, image coordinates, `look_at_image`

**Notebook 4 — Hearing & Speaking (Audio)**
👉 Microphones, speakers, Direction of Arrival (DoA)

**Notebook 5 — Feeling Motion (IMU)**
👉 Accelerometer, gyroscope, orientation (Wireless only)

---

### 🔵 Level 3 — Creating

**Notebook 6 — Recording & Replaying Motions**
👉 Record moves, replay them, use motion libraries

**Notebook 7 — Building Complete Behaviors (Capstone)**
👉 Combine vision, audio, motion, and interaction

Examples:

* Look-at-click interaction
* Sound-reactive motion
* Teach-by-demonstration behavior

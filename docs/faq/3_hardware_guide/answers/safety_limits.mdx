Limits:

1. Motors have limited mechanical range.
2. Head can collide with the body.
3. Body yaw: [-180°, 180°].
4. Head pitch and roll: [-40°, 40°].
5. Head yaw: [-180°, 180°].
6. Difference (body_yaw - head_yaw): [-65°, 65°].

If commanded pose exceeds these limits, the robot will clamp to the nearest safe pose (no exception is thrown).

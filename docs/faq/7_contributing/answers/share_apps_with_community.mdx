Recommended workflow:

- Wrap your behavior in a `ReachyMiniApp`.
- Publish as a Hugging Face Space (web based and added as a favourite on your dashboard) or Python package (directly installable via the dashboard).
- See the example space: [`reachy_mini_app_example`](https://huggingface.co/spaces/pollen-robotics/reachy_mini_app_example).

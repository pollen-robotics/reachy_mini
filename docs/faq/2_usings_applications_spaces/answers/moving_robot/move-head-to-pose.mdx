Use `goto_target` with a pose created by `create_head_pose`:

```python
from reachy_mini import ReachyMini
from reachy_mini.utils import create_head_pose

with ReachyMini() as mini:
    mini.goto_target(head=create_head_pose(y=-10, mm=True))

```

- `create_head_pose` builds a 4x4 transform matrix (position + orientation).
- `mm=True` means translation arguments are in millimeters.
- The head frame is located at the base of the head.

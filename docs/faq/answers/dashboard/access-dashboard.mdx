Install the SDK inside a virtual environment and ensure the correct version is used. Some users fixed the issue by upgrading the SDK.

Checklist:

1. Use a proper Python virtual environment (`.venv`).
2. Install or update the Reachy Mini SDK inside that environment:
    
    ```bash
    pip install -U reachy-mini
    ```
    
3. Make sure the daemon is running.

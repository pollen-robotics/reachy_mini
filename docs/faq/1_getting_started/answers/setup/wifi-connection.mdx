1. Power on your Reachy Mini.
2. Reachy Mini will create its own access point: "reachy-mini-ap". It should appear in the list of available Wi-Fi networks on your computer or smartphone after a few moments.
3. Connect your computer to the `reachy-mini-ap` Wi-Fi network (password: `reachy-mini`). Or you can directly scan the QR-code below to join the network:

4. Open a web browser and go to http://reachy-mini.local:8000/settings to access the configuration page.
5. Enter your Wi-Fi network credentials (SSID and password) and click "Connect".
6. Wait a few moments for Reachy Mini to connect to your Wi-Fi network. The access point will disappear once connected. If the connection fails, Reachy Mini will restart the access point, and you can try again.

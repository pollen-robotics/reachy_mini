Call `start_recording()` and `stop_recording()` around the time where you send `set_target` commands:

```python
with ReachyMini() as mini:
    mini.start_recording()
    # run your teleop / control code ...
    recorded_motion = mini.stop_recording()
```

Each recorded frame contains:

- `time`
- `head`
- `antennas`
- `body_yaw`

Tools to record and upload datasets:

- `reachy_mini_toolbox/tools/moves`
